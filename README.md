# HTML-code
This is the HTML work that I created while studying web production in the first year of college. although I'm more experienced with producing NET applications and games using unity I'm am welcome to learning some HTML in order to create a great website under my name and domain (its hard though because I have no way in order to host a website or any knowledge of making my own network)
